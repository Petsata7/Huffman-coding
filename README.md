# Huffman-coding
Part of my data structures course

This program allows you to archive directories, using cannonical Huffman algorithm.
The commands are taken from the command line.

-Pack (first argument is the directory to be archived, the second is the file to be created)
 example: > Archive.exe -Pack C:\Test C:\Temp\myfile.arc

-Unpack (first argument is the file to be unarchived, the second is the directory where to)
 example: > Archive.exe -Unpack C:\Temp\myfile.arc C:\AnotherDirectory\

-List (the only argument is path to an existing archive)
 example > Archive.exe -List C:\Temp\myfile.arc
